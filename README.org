This package provides a list of commands to be able to fetch, add, modify and
remove events to Apple's Calendar app.

* Installation
=maccalfw= can be installed with the following =use-package= command, assuming
that you have straight installed.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package maccalfw
    :commands maccalfw-open
    :straight (:host github
                     :repo "haji-ali/maccalfw"
                     :files ("maccalfw.el" ("src" . "src"))))
#+end_src

You will need to have the Swift compiler (=swiftc=) which is needed to compile
the internal module.

Emacs must also have access to your Apple Calendars which means that you will
need to add the following to Emacs' =Info.plist= (for example inside
=/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Info.plist=) somewhere inside the outer
=<dict>= tag

#+begin_src xml
  <key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Emacs requires permission to access the calendar for maccalfw.el to work.</string>
#+end_src

and restart Emacs so that when =maccalfw= requests access you will be shown a
permission dialog that you can approve.

* Configuration
There's no further configuration needed. You can call =maccalfw-open= to open
a =week= view of the calendar using =calfw=.

This is how my calendar looks vs my Apple's calendar.

If you want to recreate a similar parity with Apple's calendar then you may
want to use my forks of [[https://github.com/haji-ali/emacs-calfw][calfw]] and [[https://github.com/haji-ali/calfw-blocks][calfw-blocks]].
